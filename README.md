## Baba Is You
Baba Is You is a puzzle game where the rules you have to follow are present as blocks you can interact with. By manipulating them, you can change how the game works, repurpose things you find in the levels and cause surprising interactions! The game on PC can be downloaded [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/).\
In this project we rebuild this game using WPF and C# with following features:
- The [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) element of the game, in which the player avatar can move blocks around
- The Undo element of the game, by pressing z, which allows you and EVERY game state to go back to the previous
- The Game-rules element of the game, which is changed when different valid phrases are
formed in the map
- Replicate the levels in the game
